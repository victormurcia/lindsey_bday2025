My Mooncakes,

Happy birthday, mi amor.

There are many moments when words feel too small for how MASSIVE my feelings are for you but I’ll try anyway. 

Because today, of all days, you deserve to be reminded of just how amazing you are. 

You’re a thousand sunsets in a single glance. Tus ojos brillan con una luz que calma mi alma. 

You have that kind of beauty that sneaks up on you and before I knew it, I was trapped (happily so) by you. 

That soft curve of your smile? It’s the kind of beauty that makes even the stars take notes. (Yeah, I can write nice things too ;))

You’re not just captivating, you’re the warmest, most radiant thing I’ve ever known.

I hate that I can't be there with you today, and I’m truly sorry that your gift is delayed. 

You deserve something perfect, something as thoughtful and unforgettable as you are, and I promise it’s coming. 

But in this moment, I am thankful that these words, my good thoughts are able to reach you like a hug stretched across the miles.

Te extraño más de lo que las palabras pueden decir. 

The distance is hard, but you’re worth every mile, every quiet night, every moment spent counting down until I get to see you. 

Being with you, even from afar, reminds me what matters. 

You taught me what it means to feel full, complete just from thoughts of you. 

Being with you is like finding a favorite song you never knew you were looking for, one that gets better every time it plays over and over again.

On your birthday, I want to celebrate you and all the laughter and warmth and chaos you bring into my life (which I adore), as well as the quiet moments too. 

May today feel like how you make me feel: adored and impossible seen.

Siempre tuyo,

Victor (a.k.a. lomlbean)
